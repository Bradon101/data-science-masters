Specifically Incyte was the sole donor to a fund that was opened in November 2011 to assist only myleofibrosis patients. After the fund opened the government alleges that Incyte used the fund to pay the copays of federal beneficiaries taking Jakafi who were ineligible for assistance from the fund because they did not have myleofibrosis. Incyte managers pressured the foundation through phone calls and emails to provide economic assistance to these ineligible patients and Incyte's contractor helped ineligible patients to complete applications submitted to the fund for assistance.

Specifically Incyte was the sole donor to a fund that was opened in November 2011 to assist only myleofibrosis patients. After the fund opened the government alleges that Incyte used the fund to pay the copays of federal beneficiaries taking Jakafi who were ineligible for assistance from the fund because they did not have myleofibrosis. Incyte managers pressured the foundation through phone calls and emails to provide economic assistance to these ineligible patients and Incyte's contractor helped ineligible patients to complete applications submitted to the fund for assistance. The government alleges that through this conduct Incyte caused false claims for Jakafi to be submitted to Medicare and TRICARE.</td><td>federal</td><td>agency action</td><td>Justice Department Civil Division</td><td>civil</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>USA</td><td>Delaware</td><td>publicly traded</td><td>INCY</td><td>pharmaceuticals</td><td>pharmaceuticals</td><td>https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/incyte-corporation-pay-126-million-resolve-false-claims-act-allegations-paying-kickbacks</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>Bristol-Myers Squibb</td><td>Bristol-Myers Squibb</td><td>$75000000</td><td>$0</td><td>$75000000</td><td>2021</td><td>20210401</td><td>government-contracting-related offenses</td><td>False Claims Act and related</td><td>null</td><td>Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay the United States and participating states a total of $75 million plus interest to resolve allegations that it knowingly underpaid rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
