Extraction and preparation code using AWS/databricks

Using AWS to store data and boto3 to access and prepare the data in Databricks [Extraction code using AWS](https://github.com/Bradon101/data-science-masters/blob/main/Williams_Extraction_Code.ipynb/ "Extraction code").  

For the assignment, we had to complete the assignment using a variety of different methods, noteably including using RDD, Pyspark and Hive. 

[RDD implementation ](https://github.com/Bradon101/data-science-masters/blob/main/Williams_RDD.ipynb/ "RDD code")

[Pyspark implementation](https://github.com/Bradon101/data-science-masters/blob/main/Williams_Dataframes%20(1).ipynb/ "Pyspark code")

[Hive implementation](https://github.com/Bradon101/data-science-masters/blob/main/Williams_HiveQL.sql/ "Hive code")



Following the analysis as part of our assignment, I then conducted extra analysis using Pyspark
